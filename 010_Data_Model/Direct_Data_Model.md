# DIRECT Data Model

The data model can be forward engineered from SqlDBM. Please reach out to me at [roelant@ravos.nl](mailto:roelant@ravos.nl) to setup access. SqlDBM removed the link functionality recently.

A diagram has been provided instead.

The DML and DDL code is available in the `..\DIRECT\020_DIRECT_Framework` directory.
