# Installing DIRECT

The DIRECT framework can be deployed from the Visual Studio solution/project, using the publish function. Alternatively, the project can be compiled to a DACPAC and deployed via command-line tools such as sqlcmd.

As part of the installation, post deployment scripts are run to provide the standard framework contents. Pre- and post DACPAC deployment placeholders are also available.
